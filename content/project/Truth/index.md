Should a liberal state be committed to (1) enabling individuals to pursue valid conceptions of the good and discourage evil or empty ones [@raz86a, 133]? Or (2), rather it should restrict itself to the task of providing a fair framework of rules and institutions within which citizens can pursue their own conception of what makes for a valuable life? If the liberal promote policies which promote the good, then it becomes conceivably possibly that that state can apply potentially harmful coercive policies onto its citizens.

In "Liberalism without Perfection," Jonathan Quong argues that the liberal state should pursue 2. Therefore, the liberal state is committed to providing:

1. A framework of rules and institutions
2. On which citizens can pursue their own conception of what makes for a valuable life.

This also means then, that the liberal state is under certain restrictions. These include:

3. Making no judgments about the goodness of a citizen's life.
4. Concerning itself only with the *just* distributions of freedom, resources, and other advantages between citizens.
5. Ensuring that each citizen is given a fair chance at developing and pursuing his or her own conception of the good life [@quon10a, 1].

Some examples of what the state is not allowed then, for instance, is that it cannot coerce citizens into eating a salad at every meal, I guess. However, does this mean that a politically liberal state can pursue policies which strengthen the economy? Say for instance, pursuing policies which promote profitable business models? Is that state authorized to protect the business interests of various businesses by levying tariffs on goods produced by other states, or providing subsidies on particular forms of produce? This is not clear. Lastly, what does it mean that the politically liberal state should see to it that each of its citizens are capable of pursuing the good life? How much assistance is warranted in this area?
