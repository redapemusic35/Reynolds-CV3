# Gaus - Vallier Outline

What are the proper roles for religious conviction in a ‘publicly justified polity’? What are *good* reasons for supporting a policy? According to justificatory liberalism, justifying reasons must be conclusive and they must defeat other considerations one might have.

However, according to Gerald F. Gaus and Kevin Vallier, a commitment to public justification does not provide any grounds for the exclusion of religious reasons from politics [@gaus8a, 52]. One might naturally think that this then means that each citizen of a liberal state, must have reason to accept as binding, laws based on religious convictions; even if those citizens do not hold any religious convictions themselves.

There is a worry that by justifying laws according to one’s own religious faith, the religious individual is entailing a coercive law given that they do not see any reason for non-religious individuals to accept. The error of symmetry is an argument according to which, we conceive of real constraints on which to avoid coercive laws, reasons for evaluating those laws need to be the same. As such, using the minimalist proviso, religious individuals must not use rational which is only religious in nature. All publicly justifiable laws in a liberal society then, must “have some secular rational among their various” groundings.[@gaus09a] However, if this is true, then its reverse is also true. Namely that the secular individual promotes reasons not reasonably accepted by those who hold a religious faith. As such, the secular individual should not use only rational which is secular in nature. If one’s integrity requires that the imposition on others of coercive legislation, in that it paves the way for (publicly) unjustified coercive legislation, then integrity must give way to the principle of respect [@gaus10a, 63]. One way of escape from this dilemma, is to adopt the public justification principle.

First, the argument that public justification must be based on shared reasons is based on the consensus conception of public justification. Fred D’Agnostino notes the concensus conception as:

> “If both *A* and *B* share a reason that makes a regime reasonable for them, then the justification of the regime is grounded in their consensus with respect to *R*. If *A* has a reason *R~a~* that makes the regime responsible for him, *and* *B* has a reason *R~b~* that makes the regime responsible for her, then the justification of the regime is based on *convergence* on it from separate points of view.” [@dagn96a, 30]

What D’Agostino points out here however, is that two members of a society can endorce some policy for reasons not shared by the other. If this is true, it might seem then that the consensus conception does not motivate our adherence to principles of reasonable pluralism where we might recognize that reasonable members of a liberal state will disagree on matters of religious, moral or philosophical doctrines, and the intelligibility principle, according to which all members of the public acknowledge that everyone engages in genuine reasoning. As such, each person’s conclusions provide h/her with reasons to accept the law. “As long as intelligibility obtains, all members of the public acknowledge that everyone engages in genuine reasoning such that each person’s conclusions provide her or him with reasons to accept the law [@gaus10a, 59].” The convergence principle of public justification then, is the more appropriate principle used in public justification, according to which, “members of the public may arrive at common laws by reasoning based on dirverse values and concerns [@gaus10a, 58].

It is plausible then that all laws be publicly justified on various groundings. Further, it is improtant that among these groundings are religious as well as non-religious and other reasons. Yet, will this prevent secular individuals from endorsing a law assuming that they know religious individuals will endorse the law for religious reasons?

First, doing so what amount to viewing the other as depraved. This will go directly against the intelligibility principle and reasonable pluralism both of which are held strongly by liberal politics, namely that doing so will prevent the offending citizen from acknowledging the other as a reasonable rational member of the public. If the other individual is not reasonable according to the offending citizen, then the offending individual does not view the other as free and equal.

We might ask why these principles are so important so as to entail a restraint on our public reasons—reasons which we rest on in endorsing certain public policies?
