In Quong’s “Liberalism without Perfection,”[^1] he argues that the
liberal state precludes certain discussions about a particular nature of
truth. He argues in part, that attempts have been made to suggest that
by insisting on particular liberal policies, political liberalism does
posit a kind of truth which is supposed by most political liberal
theories to be inimical to the liberal state. As such, there are two
kinds of truths which could be a part of public justification. Quong
argues that only mundane truths are justifiable in public deliberation.
However, I will argue that Collis Tahzib[^2] gives very good reasons to
think that ideas of the good—which Quong argues are not suitable for
public discussion in a liberal state—are different from the concepts of
human flourishing which most perfectionist policies advocate.
