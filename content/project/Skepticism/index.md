What might a naturalist ethic consist of? Several interpretations of Nietzsche and Hume would seem to suggest that given naturalism, morality is a misnomer. But this line of thinking quickly becomes complicated. I will explore how this question might be answered by a sentimentalist ethic. I do not expect that I will articulate a new sentimentalist ethic, but rather, by looking at some sentimentalist literature, primarily that written by Michael Slote, I hope to be able to introduce Leiter's picture in a broader literature. First, I will briefly provide some reasons why one might look towards sentimentalist literature in a discussion on ethics rather than the traditional forays such as deontology, consequentialism and Aristotelian virtue ethics. Next, I will try to offer an outline and explain some of the difficulties which exist given a naturalist ethics as presented by Leiter. However, I hope to make it clear that these traditional theories have trouble overcoming various issues rooted in skepticism. I believe this is one of the reasons why moral skeptical questions persists. A difficulty which I will argue, consists of a lack of general boundaries regarding issues in meta-ethics. Ultimately it is not clear what the views are and how they are delineated. Given all this, what I hope this project ends up reflecting, is a taxonomy of sorts, one which is framed by Leiter in his treatment of Nietzsche.
