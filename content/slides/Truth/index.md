2. Citizens of a politically liberal society are free and equal and have varying views about the good life.

---

3. Yet, political liberalism must either
  1. Assert one or more truths about the nature of moral values.
  2. Or that it only makes sense if we posit skepticism about peopleâ€™s capacity to know the truth about the good life.

3. However citizens in a politically liberal society are only concerned with mundane truths because there is plausible disagreement regarding metaphysical truth.

---

4. No one view is seen as having more weight than another.

5. Therefore, the traditional objections to perfectionism, 1, confuses the truths under discussion.
