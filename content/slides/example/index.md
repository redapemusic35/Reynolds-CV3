Happen to know that people have a connection to the department. Here are some potential speakers, we were hoping that someone here had ideas. 

Should be on a wide variety of topics, but must explicitly address the question of how empathy contributes (or fails to contribute) to knowledge. Potential presentation/paper topics or titles could include (but are not limited to):

1. What Sort of Skepticism could be ascribed to Hume.
2. In what what is this skepticism related to what is now called Sentimentalism?


- First, Foelin argues that Hume's skepticism is a skepticism which is about what we can know based on our particular psychological and cognitive profiles shared as between us owing to our human nature. It is a skepticism which questions what we know given our cognitive capacties.



---

* Experience and Observation

> One clue to the nature of Hume's skepticism is given in the sentence that immediately follows his claim that the philosophy found in the *Treatise* 'is very skeptical, and tends to give us a notion of the imperfections and narrow limits of human understanding.'"[@foge09a, find page number]


{%/* speaker_note */%}
- Experience and observation are central to reasoning according to Fogelin's Hume. What does this mean? What are the implications? Does he mean to say that it is only through experience that we can reason about things or is he saying that we must first start from observation in order to reason?

---

## Some possible understandings

1. All reasoning is reduced to experience because of the way we come to believe things about the world.
2. Belief is produced through custom (experience).
3. And this is skepticism.


{{%/* speaker_note */%}}
- It is commonly agreed that for Hume, that belief is produced by custom or habit. However, it seems that Fogelin would argue that typical interpretations of Hume skirt the distinction between fallabilism and pyrrhonian skepticism. First, fallabilism is not a form of skepticism. At least not in the sense of pyrrhonian skepticism. It is milder exactly because it does not infer that knowledge requires certainty. However, I think it would be good to point out that what makes fallabilism a milder form of skepticsm is that according to it, empricism is based on the view that knowledge requires certainty by pyrrhonist think that this is too dogmatic.

## Hume's science of the mind

> For Hume, understanding the workings of the mind is the key to understanding everything else [@brio09a, 41]...philosophical attempts at justifying our beliefs...[@brio09a, 45]"

---

However...

> "recognition of our unreflective, instinctive, and unavoidable acceptance of certain basic beliefs must not be confused with claiming to have a philosophical justification of those beliefs [45]"


{{%/* speaker_note */%}}
- So the question which remains is; how do we understand reflective belief which itself is founded on un-reflective or reflexive (habit) beliefs which themselves are unjustifiable? His answer is to give us a theory of personal identity which the agent is responsible for the beliefs that they hold. identity is that which unities the underlying processes of human cognition on which he bases his theory of mind.
