### Abstract

Should the liberal state:

1. Enable indivudals to pursue valid conceptions of the good and discourage evil or empty ones? [@raz86a, 133]

Or should it...

2. Restrict itself to the task of providing a fair framework of rules and institutions within which citizens can pursue their own conception of what makes for a valuable life?

#### Jonathan Quong in "Liberalism without Perfection"...

... argues that the liberal state should pursue 2.

- on which citizens can pursue their own conception of what makes for a valuable life.

## Therefore the liberal state should...

1. Make no judgments about the goodness of a citizen's life.
2. Should only concern itself with the just distributions of freedom, resources, and other advantages between citizens.
3. Ensure that each citizen is given a fair chance to develop and pursue his or her own conception of the good life [@quon10a, 1]

- for instance, cannot coerce them into eating a salad at every meal.
- However, a politically liberal state can pursue policies which strengthen the economy.
- Last, the PL state should that each of its citizens are capable of pursuing the good life.

#### 2. Two problems faced by Raz's argument for personal autonomy. 

{{% speaker_note %}}
- Raz's account fails to yield a principled commitment to liberal toleration. Rather, it is contingetn on certain empirical assumptions. These assumptions should be treated irrelecvant to a liberal theory of toleration.
- The harm principle employed by the argument from autonomy does not provide reasons to treat non-coerciive perfectionism differently from coercive perfectionism.
- Finally, because Raz's argument from autonomy cannot preclude the kinds of non-coercive polices liberal perfectionists advocate, the value of autonomy cannot provide the foundation for liberal perfectionism in the same way many contemporary perfectionists have assumed.

#### 3. Liberal Perfectionism...

Is a paternalistic doctrine. It does not recognize citizens as free equal.

{{% speaker_note %}}
wever, they hold 
- PPs can be purued by non-coercive mthods.
- However, they imply a negative judgment about the ability of citizens to make good decisions and run their own lives.
- Therefore, perfectionism does not accord citizens the full moral status of free and equal agents.

## 4. Perfectionism lacks an account of political legitimacy

{{% speaker_note %}}
- Perfectionists have claimed that "if citizens would be justified in following perfectionist directives issued by a state, this is sufficient to show the state has the moral right to rule over those citizens" [@quon10a, 9]
- However, what justifies an institutions is not what legitimates an institution.
- Therefore liberal perfectionism lacks a convincing account of how the liberal state gains the moral right to rule.

#### 5. The External and Internal Conception of Political Liberalism

1. On the external view, pluralism is a fact about the world.
2. On the internal view, pluralism is an essential and necessary feature.

{{% speaker_note %}}
- ON the external view, pluralism is a fact about the world.
- Liberalism ought to accommodate itself in the face of pluralism. If liberalisms foundational norms and principles cannot be justified to "diverse constituency of persons that inhabit modern liberal societies," then liberal rights and institutions are not justifiable and therefore lack legitimacy.
- On this view then, political liberalism seeks to vindicate liberal norms and principles in the face of deep disagreement about the good life that characterizes modern societies [@@quon10a, 138--139].
- As such, on the interal view, political liberalism does not need to accommodate pluralism. On this view, pluralism is derivative of liberalism. "Human rationality exercised in good faith under liberal conditions produces permanent disagreement about the good life [@quon10a, 139].

#### 6. The Role for the Idea of an Overlapping Consensus among Citizens of a Politically Liberal Society.

{{% speaker_note %}}
- First, pl mistakes agreement for justification. Consensus justifies policy.
- Real and reasonable persons however are superfluous to political justification.
- But the internal conception avoids this by showing that overlapping consensus is the first stage of the justificatory structure of pl. To reject this principle is to reject the liberal state.

#### 7. PL's Defensible Asymmetrical Treatment of Disagreements.

1. PL treats concerns about justice differently from concerns about the good.

{{% speaker_note %}}
- Reasonable people disagree about justice as much as they do about the good life. Why does PL permit the state to enforce controversial conceptions of justice but not of the good.
- There are two kinds of disagreements between reasonable people, justificatory and foundational.
- Justificatory disagreements are framed by common premises or assumptions, foundational ones are fully comprehensive.
- Disagreements about justice are framed by common premises or assumptions, foundational ones are not similarly framed.

8. Objections about appeals to truth or scepticism in political philosophy are misguided. Political liberalism criterion of reasonable acceptability can posit the priority of liberal justice while avoiding controversial claims about truth and skepticism.

{{% speaker_note %}}
1. Liberals usually hold that claims about justice have priority over claims about other values in practical deliberations. 
2. This poses problems for Rawlsian political liberalism: 
  (a) first the commitment to abstain from appeals to truth 
      and to 
  (b) avoid scepticism about our capacity to know the good. 
3. Therefore political liberalism cannot justify commitment to the good without going against either a) or b).
4. However there are two kinds of truths which Political liberalism can appeal to: mundane truths and metaphysical truths. Metaphysical truths cannot attract widespread agreement in a politically liberal society because of the nature of political liberalism. Further, mudane truths are those already accepted by citizens of a politically liberal society and it is these which makes them politically liberal.
5. Political liberalism “passes the buck” of defending truth of theories about the good life to “reasonable citizens in a well-ordered society [@quon10a, 226].”

##### So against Raz’s claim that “Rawl’s theory cannot successfully abstain from certain truth claims,” Quong argues:

1. In a liberal society, pluralism about the good is the derivative outcome.
2. This means that the job of defending certain truth claims falls to the citizens of liberal societies and not the political theorist.

#### 9. We should always want our political principles to be justifiable to others on terms those others can reasonably accept.

{{% speaker_note %}}
1. Public justification requires public reasons, reasons which *everyone* can recognize as valid political considerations.
2. All our political decisions and deliberations should be governed by the idea of public reason. We should want our own political principles to be justifiable to others on terms those others can reasonably accept.

#### 10. 

> Though *unreasonable* people can be rightfully excluded from “the constituency of of justification in liberal theory, [@quon10a, 11]” these persons still have the same political status as other citizens and therefore receive the same rights and benefits as everyone else.
