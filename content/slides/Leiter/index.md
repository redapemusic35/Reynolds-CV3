# Abstract

---

* What Sort of Skepticism could be ascribed to Leiter?
* In what what is this skepticism related to what is now called Sentimentalism?
* What is a naturalist ethic?
* What is Leiter denying?
* How can the traditional theorist respond?
* What better response can the sentimentalist give?
* How does this improve on the traditional responses?
* Why might a Christian sentimentalist response be better than a traditional
  sentimentalist?

- First, Foelin argues that Hume's skepticism is a skepticism which is about what we can know based on our particular psychological and cognitive profiles shared as between us owing to our human nature. It is a skepticism which questions what we know given our cognitive capacties.

## Nietzsche's Metaphysical Anti-Realism about Value

1. All reasoning is reduced to experience because of the way we come to believe things about the world.
2. Belief is produced through custom (experience).
3. And this is skepticism.
