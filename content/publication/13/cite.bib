 abstract = {In this multidisciplinary volume, the capacity of music to express and arouse emotions is explored by musicians and composers, philosophers, musicologists, historians, sociologists, psychologists and neuroscientists. Contributors present new insights and approaches into issues such as; How can an abstract sequence of sounds be so intensely expressive of emotional states? How does music elicit or arouse our emotions? What happens at the physiological and neural level when we listen to music? How do composers and performers practically manage the expressive powers of music? How have societies sought to harness the powers of music for social or therapeutic purposes? The volume presents both theoretical perspectives and in-depth explorations of particular musical works, as well as first-hand reports from music performers and composers. This volume is suited for both academic professionals interested in the latest developments in the field, and students wishing to get an introduction to these fascinating questions.},
