I am a first year Doctoral student in the department of Philosophy at
Saint Louis University. My research interests include Epistemology (mostly
virtue), Philosophy of Religion and Philosophy of Mind and philosophy of
Music. However, my primary focuses currently are characteristic virtues of agents and how these are developed. Presently, I am researching ways in which music and narratives can influence the development of human virtues in each of the above areas. Two methods that I am researching in this area are those of topic modeling and sentiment analysis using Stanford's NLP (Natural Language Processing). When I am not reading about or writing about virtue, I
enjoy spending my free time with my wife Amanda and our two darling children.
