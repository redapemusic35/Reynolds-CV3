I am a first year Doctoral student in the department of Philosophy at Saint Louis University. My research interests include Epistemology (mostly virtue), Philosophy of Religion and Philosophy of Mind and philosophy of Law. However, my primary focus are characteristic virtues of agents in each of the above areas. When I am not reading about or writing about virtue, I enjoy spending my free time with my wife Amanda and our two darling children.
